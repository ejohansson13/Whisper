# Whisper

In this repository, you'll find an explanation of OpenAI's automated speech recognition and transcription model Whisper. Normally, when explaining these machine learning models, I take a deep dive into the architectural improvements leveraged by researchers leading to SOTA performance. In this case, researchers intentionally utilized an off-the-shelf Transformer architecture. After briefly summarizing the Transformer model, we'll take a look at the engineering improvements made by researchers for the blazing quick inference most users associate with Whisper.
