[Whisper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04356), released in 2022, quickly grew to be one of the most popular ASR models and demonstrated the efficacy of the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) model across media, introducing it to a new domain: speech. Whisper's release was intended to monitor the empirical impact of large, weakly-supervised data on an off-the-shelf model architecture. Previous speech recognition models had either been trained on large, unsupervised data, lacking quality, or small, gold-standard training data, lacking quantity. The novel dataset size was referenced in the authors' begrudging apellation of their work: WSPSR (Whisper) standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition.
